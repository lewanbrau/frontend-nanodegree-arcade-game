How to play:
============
Use your arrow keys to move the player character around. 
Goal is to move your character to the water without
touching any of the bugs in your path.

Once you touch the water, your character will be moved back to
the starting location.

If you get hit by a bug, your character will also move back to the
starting location.

Good Luck!!!
